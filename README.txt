Welcome to the Headers Tutorial!
Prerequesites: None

The game Quake 2 had 130,000+ lines of code
The game Doom 3 had 600,000+ lines of code

Imageine if all that code was inside main.cpp, that would be insane.
In this tutorial, we show you how to put code into "header" files (.h).
By breaking up code into multiple files, this helps the code become more organized.
In the next tutorial, we will show how to use multiple (.cpp) files.
